SAFE BODA CHALLENGE

INTRODUCTION
This project is a Hackothorn graduation project from Code Queen


The challenge 
Design and build a ​responsive​ driver onboarding website that can be used for driver 
registration and tracking through their onboarding process. 
It is important for this site to be responsive so that device size is not a limitation for recruiters in 
the field and those at the academy can still use it on their computers.

A system user should be able to: 
● Access the system through a proper authentication system 
● Register a driver through a registration form

registration point 
● View a list of drivers at the different stages of onboarding and be able to select and view 
a specific driver profile 
 
Bonus features 
● Visualise number of drivers registered on the system daily, weekly. 
● Visualise number of drivers registered per system user daily, weekly. 
● Download sheet of drivers at a given ​stage​ based on the date they were registered.
